                    <h3>1890: Michael Collins is Born</h3>
                    <p>Michael Collins was born on October 16, 1890, in Woodfield, County Cork, Ireland. He was the youngest of eight children in a farming family.

                <h3>1921: Collins serves as one of the principal negotiators for the Anglo-Irish Treaty</h3>
                <p>
                    In 1921, Michael Collins found himself at the forefront of negotiations that would shape the future of Ireland.

            <h3>1922: Collins plays a significant role in the Irish Civil War</h3>
            <p>
                In 1922, the Irish Civil War erupted, and Michael Collins found himself thrust into a significant role that would shape the course of the conflict. As a key figure in the pro-independence movement and a leading member of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), Collins played a complex and influential role in the war. The conflict arose from deep divisions within the nationalist movement over the acceptance of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which established the Irish Free State but fell short of the complete independence sought by some.

                Collins, having played a pivotal role in negotiating the treaty, found himself in the position of defending its provisions against anti-treaty forces led by his former comrade Éamon de Valera. Collins firmly believed that the treaty represented a step forward for Ireland, providing a foundation upon which future independence could be built. As the Commander-in-Chief of the National Army, Collins demonstrated his military acumen and strategic brilliance, leading the pro-treaty forces against their anti-treaty counterparts.
                
                Collins' tactics were characterized by a combination of conventional warfare and guerrilla tactics that he had employed during the War of Independence. He utilized intelligence networks, quick strikes, and mobile warfare to outmaneuver and weaken the anti-treaty forces. Collins' leadership and determination were instrumental in securing a series of military victories, allowing the pro-treaty forces to gain the upper hand in several regions of Ireland.          </p>

                However, the Irish Civil War was a bitter and divisive conflict that took a heavy toll on the nation. The war tore apart families, communities, and friendships, leaving scars that would last for generations. Tragically, Collins' role in the war was cut short when he was killed in an ambush in August 1922. His death was a devastating blow to the pro-treaty side and a significant loss for the nascent Irish Free State.

                Despite the complexities and controversies surrounding the Irish Civil War, Collins' role in the conflict remains a subject of both admiration and criticism. He was a dedicated and charismatic leader who displayed unwavering commitment to his vision of an independent Ireland. While his actions during the war continue to be debated, there is no denying the significant impact he had on shaping the outcome of the conflict.
