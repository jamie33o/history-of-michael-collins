His father, Michael John Collins, passed away when he was just six years old, leaving his mother, Mary Anne O'Brien Collins, to raise the children on her own. Despite the financial challenges they faced, Collins's mother prioritized education and ensured that he received a good education. Collins attended the local national school and later went on to study at the prestigious Clonakilty National School and the prestigious Castleknock College in Dublin. These formative years in rural Ireland shaped Collins's early life and instilled in him a passion for his country and its struggle for independence</p>
